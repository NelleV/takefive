Visualizing counts
==================

This folder contains the code use to visualize normalized contact counts and
O/E matrices.

To reproduce figure 3, run the following command::

  python figure_counts.py

To generate the whole set of contact maps images, simply type::

  make

This will (1) normalize the data using iced; (2) plot the contact counts maps
genome-wide and chromosome per chromosome; (3) plot the O/E maps both
genome-wide and chromosome per chromosome.
