Plan détaillé du papier:

- Lemieux et al!! 
  - Can I use any of their analysis? 
  - How about the data?
- Our review on the plasmodium's epigenetic


- Analysing contact count data
  - Normalization
  - Quality assessment
  - Enrichment of counts
  - Anything else?
     - Did we do a compartment analysis?
  - Can we extend it?
    - Fit-Hic ?
- 3D structure inference
  - How did we do it? MDS with constraints.
  - Extensions:
    - MDS
    - *PO
    (- NB)
  - Are the results stable? Can we say anything from analysing the population
    of structures?
- Volume exclusion models
  - How did we do this experiment?
  - Does it extend?
     - *Can we add constraints on VRSSM genes?
- Integrative analysis of 3D architecture and genome expression.
  - How did we do it?
  - Can we extend it to more complex settings?
    - *Population of structures?
    - *How about different data sets?
    - Are the results stable?
    - How does it compares to performing a simple PCA on the gene expression
      and plotting the results?
- Conclusion

Information for Authors

OPEN ACCESS OPTION FOR AUTHORS

Biostatistics publishes papers that develop innovative statistical methods
with applications to the understanding of human health and disease, including
basic biomedical sciences. Papers should focus on methods and applications.
Introduction of original methodology should be grounded in substantive
problems. Authors are encouraged to present extensive supporting material,
such as software or data on the journal’s website as supplementary materials.
The editors may also require authors to use the supplementary material feature
for detailed descriptions of simulation studies or other technical material as
a condition of acceptance of a paper.

Papers submitted for publication in Biostatistics should satisfy at least one
of the following criteria:

development of new stochastic models or statistical methodology clearly
motivated by a substantive problem in health or biomedical sciences;
innovative application of statistical methodology to address a substantive
problem in health or biomedical sciences;
critical review of an area of statistical methodology relevant to health or
biomedical science applications, with a focus on practical utility;
case studies based on important health or biomedical sciences data.
